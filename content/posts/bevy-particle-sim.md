## Bevy particle sim

[Bevy](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy) is a game engine written in Rust that I have taken a bit of a liking to, so [here](https://github.com/PerfectlyInternal/bevy-particle-life)'s a simple particle physics simulation writted using it. It takes advantage of Bevy's simple and flexible ECS system to efficiently parallelize computations for all the particle interactions.
