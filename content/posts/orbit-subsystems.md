## Orbit Subsystem Library

During my time at [Orbit robotics](https://1360.ca/), I recognized the need for a general-purpose library to simplify early robot coding.
Most FRC robots use one or more of several common mechanisms, such as:
- Pivoting arms
- Telescoping arms
- Flywheels
- Rollers
Since the code for these repeats every season, we developed [OrbitSubsystemLib](https://github.com/PerfectlyInternal/OrbitSubsystemsLib), which handles boilerplate code and simple logic for these subsystems. This lets teams get to programming more advanced features, such as autonomous driving, earlier, and lets them compete at a higher level.
